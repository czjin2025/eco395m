Hey everyone, I'm JIN.

I am fancinated by in economics because it use data and models to make sense of real-world problems, especially how markets work and how we can design them better.

The greatest appeal of programming is that it helps me tackle complicated practical economic issues effectively. That is why, I am currently developing my skills in Python, R and SQL.
Beyond academics, I am a sports enthusiast. I firmly believe diverse experiences can provide broader perspectives and enhance problem-solving abilities.

Really looking forward to learning with everyone in this class and working together on the cool projects.
